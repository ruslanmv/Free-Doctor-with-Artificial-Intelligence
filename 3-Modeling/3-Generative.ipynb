That too in a week I feel 1 to 2 times. Surrounding the anus also while washing sometimes I am feeling a burning sensation. I do not have any other problem of difficulty in passing the stools and it is regular and clear. I request you to suggest some medication. and I have also stopped eating spicy food.\n",
      " Answer: Hello. Intake of spicy food may cause burning sensation and irritation of anal mucosa which may lead to a burning pain during defecation. It is due to the spiciness of the food. You may try yogurt, cucumber, tender coconut water, probiotic capsules, buttermilk. Use tablet Nexium before breakfast for one week. Avoid spicy food intake. If symptoms do not improve, please consult a physician or post me a query.\n",

      " Input: Hi doctor, Whenever I eat spicy food, I feel some kind of irritation, burning sensation and pain in my gums. I do not have any cavity in my teeth. I got scaling done 2 years back. Once I stop eating spicy food, the pain fades away in few minutes. I would like to know the reason behind it. Please advice me the preventive measures as well.\n",
      " Answer: Hi. Hurting of gums while taking spicy food might be due to the following causes: 1. Gingivitis (swelling and inflammation of the gums) - Swollen gums may be painful and may cause burning sensation and pain while taking hot and spicy food. Gingivitis occurs due to either plaque or other debris accumulating around the teeth and gums. Also hormonal changes occurring during menstrual cycle can cause swollen and painful gums. Any medicines taken for medical issues like hypertension, epilepsy, etc., also cause gum changes and swelling. 2. Any ulcers in the mouth will get hurt while taking hot and spicy food. Ulcers might occur due to faulty tooth brushing techniques, usage of toothbrushes with hard bristles, stress, sharp tooth hurting the tissues, any dental appliances or ill-fitting dentures. 3. Any abscess related to infected tooth might also hurt while taking spicy food. But, you have mentioned that you do not have any cavities or teeth issues. Have you been examined by a dentist regarding this? 4. Any impacted tooth (teeth that remain unerupted due to inadequate space inside the mouth or remain inside the bone itself) may develop swelling of gums around it. When the opposing teeth impinges on this swollen tissue while taking spicy food it gets hurt. 5. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur to certain foods. This might cause swelling, reddening and burning sensation of the mouth. This may occur due to some food additives. 6. Habits like smoking and usage of tobacco products may also cause burning sensation while consuming spicy and hot food. 7. Dental procedures like scaling (cleaning of teeth) might cause minor tissue injuries. These hurt and cause burning sensation while taking hot and spicy food. But, this heals in 4-5 days after cleaning. In your case, this might not be the reason, as you have undergone scaling before 2-3 years. 1. Get dental scaling done, if you have any plaque or calculus deposits causing swollen gums. 2. Get your oral cavity examined by your dentist, for any ulcers, abscesses, infected teeth and impacted teeth. 3. Also get checked for any sharp teeth and any dental appliances or ill-fitting dentures. If found, sharp teeth have to be trimmed and reduced, and ill-fitting dentures and dental appliances have to be corrected immediately. 1. Kindly make a note if you develop any gum swelling, redness or bleeding gums during your periods. 2. Use toothbrushes with soft bristles for brushing your teeth. Also follow the proper brushing technique for brushing your teeth. 3. Make a note whenever your gum hurts and what foods hurt your gums. Check if any food causes the same issue repeatedly. In case, if that food contains some additive that causes hypersensitive reaction, then you may have to avoid that particular food in future. 4.Quit habits like smoking or usage of other tobacco products (in case you do). For further information consult a dentist online.--->\n",

      "Input: Q. I have a muscular thing right out of my anus. What it could be?\n",
      " Input: Hello doctor, What can be the muscular thing right out of my anus? I had a normal delivery a month ago, and it is almost healed. When I pass stools, I feel pain in that place with bleeding. While passing stools, the muscular thing gets torn, and blood comes out. This started a day before yesterday and now happening every day. What is the treatment for it?\n",
      " Answer: Hello. It is anal hemorrhoids (attachment removed to protect patient identity), and it is very painful. You may be suffering from constipation, or you must have been eating very spicy food. The treatment is sitz bath, and it means you have to sit in a tub full of warm water. It gets relieved, and you have to do this for two to three times a day. Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with consent. You may apply ointment Pilex over the area. Stop eating spicy food and take syrup Duphalac (Lactulose) two spoons daily at bedtime to avoid constipation. If it is not relieved, then you have to consult a general surgeon.\n",

      "Input: Q. I have diarrhea following constipation for a long time. Why?\n",
      " Input: Hi doctor, I am having a slightly upset stomach with bloating for the past four months. I thought I had a bug. Two weeks later, it seemed much better. However, my bowel movements did not return to normal. I had mostly constipation for about a month (even though my stomach did not feel as upset anymore). Then after that month, things flipped and now for the last four weeks at least, I have had movements that are almost diarrhea (very soft, formed only slightly). Colour does not seem abnormal and there is not a bad smell and I do not see oil drops in the toilet bowl. Every morning I have this. I also am having increasing stomach reactions. Every time I put food into my mouth, the gurgling starts. I am not feeling this is a food intolerance as it happens instantly no matter what I eat. I also get a lot of bloating due to the gas. I will, of course, be following up with my doctor, but wanted to ask here. I have a history of breast cancer, so I easily get concerned about cancers (I realize that breast cancer does not often spread to the bowels, but I am still worried about another cancer). I am not a person with a strong history of gastrointestinal upset. I did go through about 7 to 8 weeks of something about seven years ago and never really had a true explanation. Those symptoms accompanied many other symptoms such as nerve pain, twitching, cramping. I felt as though I was having an autoimmune type reaction and am now wondering if it was tied to hormonal changes as my periods changed at the very same time as I had those symptoms (perimenopause). I am currently on Letrozole for hormone positive breast cancer targeted therapy. I had my ovaries out two years ago. So my body is definitely experiencing a massive drop in estrogen over the past two years. I am wondering if you have any thoughts on what this could be? No blood in the stool.\n",
      " Answer: Hi. Your history fits into the acid peptic disease. I do not find any sign of cancer over here (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I would recommend you the following. A combination of Pantoprazole and Domperidone once daily for a few days. A good probiotic, to take a soft and bland diet, to walk after all meals. I would also recommend you to get your thyroid profile checked.:\n",

I am not a person with a strong history of gastrointestinal upset. I did go through about 7 to 8 weeks of something about seven years ago and never really had a true explanation. Those symptoms accompanied many other symptoms such as nerve pain, twitching, cramping. I felt as though I was having an autoimmune type reaction and am now wondering if it was tied to hormonal changes as my periods changed at the very same time as I had those symptoms (perimenopause). I am currently on Letrozole for hormone positive breast cancer targeted therapy. I had my ovaries out two years ago. So my body is definitely experiencing a massive drop in estrogen over the past two years. I am wondering if you have any thoughts on what this could be? No blood in the stool.\\n Answer: Hi. Your history fits into the acid peptic disease. I do not find any sign of cancer over here (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I would recommend you the following. A combination of Pantoprazole and Domperidone once daily for a few days. A good probiotic, to take a soft and bland diet, to walk after all meals. I would also recommend you to get your thyroid profile checked.:\\n\\nQ. Every time I eat spicy food, I poop blood. Why?']"
